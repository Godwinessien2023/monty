		My Monty project for ALX

# Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). 
# It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

To achiever this I have sucessfuly written several opcodes of  STack (LIFO)and Queue (FIFO) to illustrate how the monty scripting language works.

some of the opcodes  in this regard are 
 - Pop
 - Pall
 - Push
 - swap
 - add
 - multiply
 - sub
 - div 
 - Pint amongs others.

This github repository contains all of the source codes headerfile and the monty executable fie that can be 
used to be tested with the bytecode contained in the bytecodes directory.

Thank you.
